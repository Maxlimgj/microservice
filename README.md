## Introduction

The **Project Name** is a community-driven project aimed at monitoring and displaying the health of plants in a garden using data gathered from Arduino and Raspberry Pi devices. By providing a visual health indicator, members of the community can easily assess the condition of the plants and take appropriate care measures when needed. This project fosters collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and responsible gardening practices among the community members.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of plant health indicators from Arduino and Raspberry Pi devices.
- A user-friendly dashboard that displays the health status of individual plants and the overall garden.
- Customizable alert system to notify community members of unhealthy plant conditions.
- Historical data storage and visualization for tracking plant health trends over time.
- Interactive and informative plant care tips to assist community members in maintaining healthy plants.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following hardware and software components:

### Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board with sensors for collecting plant data (e.g., moisture, temperature, light intensity).
- Raspberry Pi (or similar) for processing and transmitting data to the central server.
- Internet connection for data transmission and retrieval.

### Software Requirements

- Python 3.x on Raspberry Pi for data processing and server communication.
- Web server software to host the dashboard (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
- Database management system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) for data storage.
- Frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for creating the web-based dashboard.
